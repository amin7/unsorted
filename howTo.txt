[cura]
off nozzles
* go to Help -> Show configuration folder
* close cura
* In the configuration folder, go to "definition_changes"
* in that folder, find the *_settings.inst.cfg for your printer, and open it in a text editor
* add the following line to the [values] section:
machine_nozzle_temp_enabled = False
* save the file
* restart Cura
You should now no longer be able to set temperatures in Cura, and the gcode should also not have temperatures in it anymore.
